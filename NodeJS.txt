We need to use body-parser module.

var urlencodedParser = bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })

app.post('/login', urlencodedParser, function (req, res) {
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400)     //req.body have the all the data which we have submitted from client side.
  res.send('welcome, ' + req.body.username)
})

app.post('/login', urlencodedParser, function (req, res) {
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400)     //req.body have the all the data which we have submitted from client side.
res.render('path',data:req.body);  // to send the data to the view
})
